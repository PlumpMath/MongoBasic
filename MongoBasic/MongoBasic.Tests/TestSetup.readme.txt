##TEST SETUP##

Because this library deals with MongoDb connections, we actually need to be able to connect
to a Mongo Server. So, in order to run the tests, make sure you have the following Mongo
databases configured, and that you can connect to them.

* Test Mongo Server without auth

Address	: localhost
Port		: 27016
Database	: mongobasic

* Test Mongo Server with auth

Address	: localhost
Port		: 27016
Database	: mongobasicauth
User		: mongobasic
Password	: monogbasic
Auth		: CRC
